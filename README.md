## Description:
![Stronger Minds website in different viewports](assets/readme-images/am-i-responsive.png)

**Stronger Minds** - is dedicated to raising mental health awareness, providing resources, support, and practical tips to help individuals thrive. Discover information on common issues, access helpful links, and find encouragement for your mental well-being.

It is a single page website created using HTML, CSS and Bootsrap (Ver 5.3.7).

## Design and Planning:

### Typography:
[fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/) was used to find different pairings of font to see what would look good together.

Merriweather was chosen for readability in heading elements, and Poppins for a slight gentleness.

[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was then used to import the fonts into the CSS file.

### Colour Scheme:
The general color scheme of the site is of light blue-ish/grey tones as shown in this screenshot:

However, some additional colours may come from the images, as mentioned in the Images & Icons section below.

### Images and Icons:
Images, Icons and Logos used in the website were either generated usingChatGPT or taken from existing AI images on [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/).

## AI
The most significant use of AI was through the creation of [images](#images-and-icons), additionally with initial designing of the [colour palette.](#colour-scheme)

Github Copilot (connected with VSCode) was also used to help with debugging or adding quick lines/fixes of code in HMTL or CSS, to help prevent spending a lot of time on small things.

## Bugs
Currently known: 
- non-breaking bugs:
    - Quotes carousel uses text based quotes, so it looks slightly glitchy/jittery when changing. Most specifically for quotes that are slightly longer. Easy fix would be to just used image based quotes of the same sizes.

Throughout development:
- Fixed:
    - Margin and padding issues in different screen sizes, fixed along the way when creating site.

## Deployment

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.
#### Deloying on Github
The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:
- Go to the Github repository.
- Navigate to the 'settings' tab.
- Using the 'select branch' dropdown menu, choose 'main'.
- Click 'save'.
